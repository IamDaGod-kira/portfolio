EGGS:When something starts pecking its way out of the shell, the egg is probably past its prime. DAIRY PRODUCTS:Milk is spoiled when it starts to look like yoghurt.  Yoghurt is spoiled when it starts to look like cottage cheese.  Cottage cheese is spoiled when it starts to look like regular cheese.  Regular cheese is nothing but spoiled milk anyway and can\'t get any more spoiled than it is already.  Cheddar cheese is spoiled when you think it is blue cheese but you realise you\'ve never purchased that kind. MAYONNAISE:If it makes you violently ill after you eat it, the mayonnaise is spoiled. FROZEN FOODS:Frozen foods that have become an integral part of the defrosting problem in your freezer compartment will probably be spoiled (or wreckedanyway) by the time you pry them out with a kitchen knife. EXPIRATION DATES:This is NOT a marketing ploy to encourage you to throw away perfectly good food so that you\'ll spend more on groceries.  Perhaps you\'d benefit by having a calendar in your kitchen. MEAT:           If opening the refrigerator door causes stray animals from a three-block radius to congregate outside your house, the meat is spoiled. BREAD:Sesame seeds and Poppy seeds are the only officially acceptable \\"spots\\" that should be seen on the surface of any loaf of bread.  Fuzzy and hairy-looking white or green growth areas are a good indication that your bread has turned into a pharmaceutical laboratory experiment. FLOUR:Flour is spoiled when it wiggles. SALT:It never spoils. CANNED GOODS:Any canned goods that have become the size or shape of a tennis ball should be disposed of. Carefully. CARROTS:A carrot that you can tie a clove hitch in is not fresh. RAISINS AND SULTANAS:Raisins and sultanas should not be harder than your teeth. POTATOES:Fresh potatoes do not have roots, branches, or dense, leafy undergrowth. CHIP DIP:If you can take it out of its container and bounce it on the floor, it has gone bad. EMPTY CONTAINERS:Putting empty containers back into the refrigerator is an old trick, but it only works if you live with your mother or have a maid. UNMARKED ITEMS:You know it is well beyond prime when you\'re tempted to discard the Tupperware along with the food. Generally speaking, Tupperware containers should not burp when you open them. GENERAL RULE OF THUMB:Most food cannot be kept longer than the average life span of a hamster. Keep a hamster in or nearby your refrigerator to gauge this.","category":"Men"},{"body":"A priest and a rabbi found themselves sharing a compartment on a train.

This place has a washing machine. The first day I put four shirts in it, pulled the chain and haven\'t seen \'em since. It only rained twice this week, three days the first time and four days the second time. The coat you wanted me to send to you, Aunt Sue said it would be a little too heavy to send in the mail with them heavy buttons, so we cut them off and put them in the pockets. We got a bill from the funeral home, and it said if we didn\'t make the final payment on Grandma\'s funeral bill, up she comes. About your sister, she had a baby this morning. I haven\'t found out whether if it is a boy or girls so don  \'t know if you are an Aunt or Uncle. Your Uncle John fell in the whiskey vat.

EGGS:When something starts pecking its way out of the shell, the egg is probably past its prime. DAIRY PRODUCTS:Milk is spoiled when it starts to look like yoghurt.  Yoghurt is spoiled when it starts to look like cottage cheese.  Cottage cheese is spoiled when it starts to look like regular cheese.  Regular cheese is nothing but spoiled milk anyway and can\'t get any more spoiled than it is already.  Cheddar cheese is spoiled when you think it is blue cheese but you realise you\'ve never purchased that kind. MAYONNAISE:If it makes you violently ill after you eat it, the mayonnaise is spoiled. FROZEN FOODS:Frozen foods that have become an integral part of the defrosting problem in your freezer compartment will probably be spoiled (or wreckedanyway) by the time you pry them out with a kitchen knife. EXPIRATION DATES:This is NOT a marketing ploy to encourage you to throw away perfectly good food so that you\'ll spend more on groceries.  Perhaps you\'d benefit by having a calendar in your kitchen. MEAT:           If opening the refrigerator door causes stray animals from a three-block radius to congregate outside your house, the meat is spoiled. BREAD:Sesame seeds and Poppy seeds are the only officially acceptable \\"spots\\" that should be seen on the surface of any loaf of bread.  Fuzzy and hairy-looking white or green growth areas are a good indication that your bread has turned into a pharmaceutical laboratory experiment. FLOUR:Flour is spoiled when it wiggles. SALT:It never spoils. CANNED GOODS:Any canned goods that have become the size or shape of a tennis ball should be disposed of. Carefully. CARROTS:A carrot that you can tie a clove hitch in is not fresh. RAISINS AND SULTANAS:Raisins and sultanas should not be harder than your teeth. POTATOES:Fresh potatoes do not have roots, branches, or dense, leafy undergrowth. CHIP DIP:If you can take it out of its container and bounce it on the floor, it has gone bad. EMPTY CONTAINERS:Putting empty containers back into the refrigerator is an old trick, but it only works if you live with your mother or have a maid. UNMARKED ITEMS:You know it is well beyond prime when you\'re tempted to discard the Tupperware along with the food. Generally speaking, Tupperware containers should not burp when you open them. GENERAL RULE OF THUMB:Most food cannot be kept longer than the average life span of a hamster. Keep a hamster in or nearby your refrigerator to gauge this.","category":"Men"},{"body":"A priest and a rabbi found themselves sharing a compartment on a train.

He reaches the gorilla catcher who says that he\'ll be there in ten minutes. The gorilla catcher shows up in a big truck with a tool box in the back and a very large dog sitting on top of the tool box and a very large cage sitting in back of the tool box.  The gorilla catcher gets out of his truck and walks up to the man and shakes hands with him. The man then shows the gorilla catcher the tree and points up at the gorilla. After looking at the gorilla for a minute, the gorilla catcher walks back over to his truck and gets old Clyde off the tool box and gets out a gun and walks back over to the tree and sits the gun down next to old Clyde. The gorilla catcher looks over at the man and says, \\"Here\'s the plan. I\'m gonna climb this here tree and knock the gorilla out. When the gorilla hits the ground old Clyde here\'s gonna bite him in the nuts and hold on \'til I can get out of the tree and put the gorilla in the cage.

EGGS:When something starts pecking its way out of the shell, the egg is probably past its prime. DAIRY PRODUCTS:Milk is spoiled when it starts to look like yoghurt.  Yoghurt is spoiled when it starts to look like cottage cheese.  Cottage cheese is spoiled when it starts to look like regular cheese.  Regular cheese is nothing but spoiled milk anyway and can\'t get any more spoiled than it is already.  Cheddar cheese is spoiled when you think it is blue cheese but you realise you\'ve never purchased that kind. MAYONNAISE:If it makes you violently ill after you eat it, the mayonnaise is spoiled. FROZEN FOODS:Frozen foods that have become an integral part of the defrosting problem in your freezer compartment will probably be spoiled (or wreckedanyway) by the time you pry them out with a kitchen knife. EXPIRATION DATES:This is NOT a marketing ploy to encourage you to throw away perfectly good food so that you\'ll spend more on groceries.  Perhaps you\'d benefit by having a calendar in your kitchen. MEAT:           If opening the refrigerator door causes stray animals from a three-block radius to congregate outside your house, the meat is spoiled. BREAD:Sesame seeds and Poppy seeds are the only officially acceptable \\"spots\\" that should be seen on the surface of any loaf of bread.  Fuzzy and hairy-looking white or green growth areas are a good indication that your bread has turned into a pharmaceutical laboratory experiment. FLOUR:Flour is spoiled when it wiggles. SALT:It never spoils. CANNED GOODS:Any canned goods that have become the size or shape of a tennis ball should be disposed of. Carefully. CARROTS:A carrot that you can tie a clove hitch in is not fresh. RAISINS AND SULTANAS:Raisins and sultanas should not be harder than your teeth. POTATOES:Fresh potatoes do not have roots, branches, or dense, leafy undergrowth. CHIP DIP:If you can take it out of its container and bounce it on the floor, it has gone bad. EMPTY CONTAINERS:Putting empty containers back into the refrigerator is an old trick, but it only works if you live with your mother or have a maid. UNMARKED ITEMS:You know it is well beyond prime when you\'re tempted to discard the Tupperware along with the food. Generally speaking, Tupperware containers should not burp when you open them. GENERAL RULE OF THUMB:Most food cannot be kept longer than the average life span of a hamster. Keep a hamster in or nearby your refrigerator to gauge this.","category":"Men"},{"body":"A priest and a rabbi found themselves sharing a compartment on a train.

If drinking directly from the bottle, always hold it with your fingers covering the label. \\n\\nENTERTAINING IN YOUR HOME\\n1. A centerpiece for the table should never be anything prepared by a \\n taxidermist.\\n2. Do not allow the dog to eat at the table...no matter how good his \\n manners are. \\n\\nPERSONAL HYGIENE\\n1. While ears need to be cleaned regularly, this is a job that should \\n be done in private using one\'s OWN truck keys.\\n2. Proper use of toiletries can forestall bathing for several days. \\n However, if you live alone, deodorant is a waste of good money.\\n3. Dirt and grease under the fingernails is a social no-no, as they\\n  tend to detract from a woman\'s jewelry and alter the taste of her\\n finger foods.\\n\\nDATING (Outside the Family)\\n1. Always offer to bait your date\'s hook, especially on the first date.\\n2. Be aggressive. Let her know you\'re interested: \\"I\'ve been wanting to\\n go out with you since I read that stuff on the fillin\' station bathroom\\n wall two years ago.\\"\\n3. Establish with her parents what time she is expected back. Some will\\n say 10:00 PM; Others might say \\"Monday.\\" If the latter is the answer, \\n it is the man\'s responsibility to get her to school on time. \\n\\nTHEATER ETIQUETTE\\n1. Crying babies should be taken to the lobby and picked up immediately\\n after the movie has ended.\\n2. Refrain from talking to characters on the screen. Tests have proven \\n they can\'t hear you. \\n\\nWEDDINGS\\n1. Livestock, usually, is a poor choice for a wedding gift.\\n2. Unless you are the groom, kissing the bride for more than 5 seconds \\n may get you shot.\\n3. For the groom, at least, rent a tux. A leisure suit with a\\n cummerbund and a clean bowling shirt can create a tacky appearance.\\n4. Though uncomfortable, say \\"yes\\" to socks and shoes for this special \\n occasion. \\n\\nDRIVING ETIQUETTE\\n1. Dim your headlights for approaching vehicles; Even if the gun is\\n loaded, and the deer is in sight.\\n2. When approaching a four-way stop, the vehicle with the largest tires always has the right of way.\\n3. Never tow another car using panty hose and duct tape.\\n4. When sending your wife down the road with a gas can, it is impolite to ask her to bring back beer.\\n5. Do not have sex while traveling in a funeral procession.","category":"One Liners"},{"body":"The governors of Alabama, South Carolina, Arkansas, Georgia, and Mississippi announced today that they have made a disturbingdiscovery in their states.

We don\'t live where we did when you left home. Your dad read in the newspaper that most accidents happen within 20 miles from home, so we moved. I won\'t be able to send you the address because the last Arkansas family that lived here took the house numbers when they moved so they wouldn\'t have to change their address.  This place is really nice. It even has a washing machine. I\'m not sure it works so well though. Last week I put a load in and pulled the chain and haven\'t seen them since.  The weather isn\'t bad here. It only rained twice last week, the first time for three days and the second time for four days.  About that coat you wanted me to send you, your Uncle Stanley said it would be to heavy to send in the mail with the buttons on, so we cut them off and put them in the pockets.  John locked his keys in the car yesterday. We were really worried because it took him two hours to get me and your father out.  Your sister had a baby this morning, but I haven\'t found out what it is yet so I don\'t know if your an aunt or an uncle. The baby looks just like your brother.  Uncle Ted fell in a whiskey vat last week. Some men tried to pull him out, but he fought them off playfully and drowned. We had him cremated and he burned for three days.  Three of your friends ran off a bridge in a pick-up truck. Ralph was driving. He rolled down the window and swam to safety. Your other two friends were in back. They drowned because they couldn\'t get the tailgate down.  There isn\'t much more news at this time. Nothing much has happened.  Love, Mom  P. S.
